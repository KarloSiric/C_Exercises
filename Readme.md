<!-- Writing C Exercise Programs  -->

I am writing C programming exerices here for fun as I learn the documentation.
I find C to be incredibly important to learn for anything related to programming and computer science.
I am a huge fan of it so that is why I have decided to spend my time documenting this.

I plan on having a lot of exercises to sharpen my knowledge of programming.

Exercises will consist of mostly simpler programs to some complicated ones.
